# Craft18

Bring Minecraft Redstone circuits to life using Craft18, our physical re-creation of the game’s “circuit” mechanics using only discrete analog components. Look ma, no microcontrollers! To build even more complex circuits, link the physical world to the virtual world using our custom game plugin and game-to-physical bridge!

Also see our [circuit diagrams PDF](doc/schem.pdf) to see how each circuit is implemented!
