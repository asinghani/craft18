Blocks we need to build: (LxH)



laser cut remaining top plates / spacers
finish soldering together base plate + arduino



fill out project report form





btn height = 3.175mm + 2px = 7.9375mm ~= 7.9mm


btn = 8mm x 13mm

holes 5.7mm apart

holes 2.8mm high
holes 1.1mm wide


btn profile = 
10.3mm x 4.8mm

minus 3.5mm hole on one 10.3mm side




16px = 1.5in = 38.1mm

1px = 0.09375in = 2.38125mm


plate thickness (top of base plate to bottom of block plate):
0.428in

account for screw head diameter as well



repeater torch bottom hole
1/8" x 1/8" x 0.2in


all on glossy paper (also get like 10 or 15 extra sheets of the glossy paper)

- iron door textures: 4
- torch side textures: 90
- torch top textures: 30

- grass side textures: 150
- grass top textures: 10

- wood textures: 30
- cobblestone textures: 25
- repeater top textures: 8
- comparator top textures: 8
- repeater/comparator side textures: 35

- redstone lamp textures: 20

- redstone dust X textures: 20
- redstone dust line textures: 10

- daylight sensor top textures: 2
- daylight sensor side textures: 6





1 iron door (1x3)
	- grass block + iron door on top + space for servo
	- need to measure out servo dimensions to figure out fit


repeater slider top half (small)
button top half (small)
lever stone piece (small)

print more torch tops
print more 5mm diffusers



daylight sensor print ring + top half





5mm LED diffuser attempt (small, PETG)



make 14x torch caps



3 torches (2x2) ++
	- 2x grass block (base) + some block (wood) + torch on the side





5 repeaters (1x1.5) ++
	- grass block with repeater on top with switch + output indicator LED in the repeater

2 comparators (1x1.5) ++
	- grass block with comparator on top with + 2x output indicator LEDs on the back + always-on LED in the front


1 button (1x1.5) **** ++
	- grass block + up facing wooden button
	- button = 14.2875 W x 9.525 L x 4.7625 H
		     = 6 x 

3 levers (1x1.5) **** ++
	- grass block + up facing lever switch
	- lever base = 19.05 W x 14.2875 L x 7.14375 H
				 = 8 x 6 x 3




2 redstone lamps (1x2) **** ++
	- grass block + hollow-ish redstone lamp
	- top half printed in translucent
	- bottom half is generic block with round hole


1 daylight sensor (1x1.5) 
	- grass block + daylight sensor texture + 9x photocell
	- see solidworks file for top half
	- bottom half is generic block with round hole
	- height = 6px // 14.2875mm
	- 3.5mm base test = 1.5px




15 redstone dust (1x1)  ****
	- 3 straight 12 X
	- grass block + redstone dust + holes for light to shine through




Textures we need:
	- green grass textures (all 6 sides)
		- make sure it matches the game, the textures in the file are inconsistent
	- comparator textures
	- block-side-mount torch textures
	- redstone lamp textures
	- iron door textures
	- redstone dust on grass textures (note there's 2 separate textures for X axis and Y axis)
	- redstone dust "cross" on grass textures
	- wooden button texture
	- lever textures
	- daylight sensor texture
	- note block texture
